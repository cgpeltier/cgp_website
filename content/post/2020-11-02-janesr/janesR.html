<p>I developed an R package to more easily interact with the Janes API, called janesR (<a href="https://github.com/cgpeltier/janesR">available here</a>).</p>
<p>It currently provides functions for querying 17 different endpoints and returning tibbles ready for analysis and/or joining with other data. It also provides functions for exporting data from the same 17 endpoints into XML or JSON, if those formats are preferable.</p>
