My name is Chad Peltier and I am a data analyst at [Janes](janes.com). I am interested in data science for social good and public policy. 

I love working on data science projects that involve data wrangling of unstructured data from multiple sources, machine learning and NLP. At Janes I help create new data products, integrate Janes data with our clients' systems, as well as provide custom data projects. I wrote the janesR package to help Janes users access the Janes API. I have also worked with organizations such as the Library of Congress's Federal Research Division on data science consulting projects. 

Within defense, I specialize in the analysis of emerging defense technologies, R&D strategy, U.S.-China policy, and the use of data science for open source intelligence (OSINT). You can find some of my work at places like [War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/put-your-money-where-your-strategy-is-using-machine-learning-to-analyze-the-pentagon-budget/), the [U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission](https://www.uscc.gov/research/chinas-logistics-capabilities-expeditionary-operations), and [Janes](https://customer.janes.com/Janes/Display/FG_2109926-JIBR).
