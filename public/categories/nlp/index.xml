      <description>This project is designed to compare Fleet Foxes’ four albums. It uses the spotifyr and geniusr packages to download song features and lyrics, allowing for text analysis of lyrics for each track. I’ll use various NLP tools, including sentiment analysis and LDA to provide unsupervised classification of tracks on each album.
